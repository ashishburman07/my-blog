Hi, Software engineers nearly make up to 60 % of IT Employee (there are data related people as well), also they need to be in their toes as they have to keep up with the pace at which tech is evolving and  expanding in terms of technology and best practices.  

A fresher and and experienced  engineer are no different in this world, they both have to be in the queue to educate themselves.  Here are few points which a Software engineer (basically an IT guy) should incorporate in themselves to survive. 


1) Obviously to Learn new Tech. One has to learn what is coming next or what features/bug fixes has the new release brought in. Say Java has its releases every year now, hence to understand the new features how to implement them, will it improve any aspect of my project etc. all need to be played around with.

2)  Never have I know Everything, it will make your life hell, as expectation from you will be high and if you r not able to meet that, it will have a bad impact in everyone's mind. 

3) Always know the project specification which you are working on,  this project is having xyz tech stack and it has so and so versions of the tech, it will make you sound more technical and help in solving issues which may cause due to version mismatch or related to it.

4) Have a good knowledge in any one programing language and Framework say you know how to implement a map in java so it will not be difficult for you to implement a map in python or JavaScript (syntax can be googled) . Also if you know how to implement batch process in Spring boot then it will be relatively easy for you to implement in Django or some other framework. 

5)  Learn to read the doc and then jump into hands On or look for a resource which explains it well as it will be tough to go directly after a video. 

6) Make a good practice of debugging, as it will help you understand the flow of code and the business of the project. Also you will explore other options which could help in finding/resolving the bug.

7) Most importantly code at least one program daily or once in two days, be it any program simple or complex. It will keep your brain healthy.
